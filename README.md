# Netflix Recommender System Challenge

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a movie recommendation system inspired by the Netflix Prize competition. The goal is to predict user ratings for films, improving upon Netflix's own algorithm Cinematch.

## Dataset

The dataset is based on the Netflix Prize dataset, containing:
- 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers 
- Over 17 thousand movie titles
- Dates of ratings, ranging from 1999 to 2005

## Approach

Our recommendation system uses the classic approach of collaborative filtering with matrix factorization.
